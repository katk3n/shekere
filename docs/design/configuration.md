# Configuration System Specification

## Overview

The application uses TOML configuration files to define application behavior, visual effects, and audio integration settings. The configuration system is designed to be flexible and extensible.

## Configuration Structure

### Required Sections

#### `[window]`
Defines the application window properties:
- `width`: Window width in pixels
- `height`: Window height in pixels

#### `[[pipeline]]`
Array of pipeline configurations for shader processing:
- Shader configuration and compilation settings
- Multiple pipelines can be defined for complex effects

### Optional Sections

#### `[osc]`
OSC (Open Sound Control) integration for real-time audio control:
- Port configuration for OSC message reception
- Sound mapping configuration
- Integration with tools like Tidalcycles

#### `[spectrum]`
Audio spectrum analysis configuration:
- FFT-based real-time audio analysis
- Configurable frequency range settings
- System audio input processing

#### `[hot_reload]`
Live coding and development features:
- `enabled`: Boolean flag to enable/disable hot reload
- File watching for automatic shader recompilation

## Configuration Resolution

- Configuration file path determines shader file resolution directory
- Relative paths in configuration are resolved relative to the config file location
- Example configuration files are provided in the `examples/` directory

## Design Principles

### Flexibility
The configuration system allows for various deployment scenarios without requiring code changes. Applications can be configured for different audio sources, visual effects, and interaction modes.

### Extensibility
New configuration sections can be added without breaking existing configurations. The modular design allows for future expansion of features.

### Validation
Configuration parsing includes validation to ensure required sections are present and values are within acceptable ranges.
