# Hot Reload System Specification

## Overview

The hot reload system enables live coding and development workflows by automatically recompiling and reloading shaders when source files are modified. This system is designed for safety and reliability, ensuring the application continues running even when shader compilation fails.

## Core Features

### File Watching
- Uses the `notify` crate to monitor WGSL file changes
- Automatically detects file modifications in real-time
- Supports multiple shader files simultaneously

### Error Safety
- WGSL compilation errors are caught using `std::panic::catch_unwind()`
- Pipeline creation errors are handled gracefully
- Error handling ensures the application never crashes due to shader issues

### Graceful Degradation
- On compilation error, the existing render pipeline is maintained
- Application continues running with the last successful shader
- Visual feedback or logging indicates compilation failures

### Auto Recovery
- After file modification, automatic reload is attempted
- No manual intervention required for successful recompilation
- Seamless transition to updated shaders when compilation succeeds

## Configuration

### Enable Hot Reload
```toml
[hot_reload]
enabled = true
```

### Disable Hot Reload
```toml
[hot_reload]
enabled = false
```

Or simply omit the `[hot_reload]` section entirely (defaults to disabled).

## Development Workflow

### Live Coding Support
- Modify shader files in real-time
- See changes reflected immediately in the application
- Iterate quickly on visual effects without restarting

### Error Handling Workflow
1. Developer modifies shader file
2. Hot reload system detects file change
3. Shader compilation is attempted
4. If successful: New pipeline is created and activated
5. If failed: Error is logged, existing pipeline continues

### Performance Considerations
- File watching has minimal performance impact
- Shader compilation only occurs on file changes
- No impact on render loop performance

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety
- File watching runs on separate threads
- Shader compilation is isolated from render thread
- Thread-safe communication between file watcher and render loop

### Memory Management
- Old pipelines are properly cleaned up after successful recompilation
- Resource management prevents memory leaks during development cycles

### Integration with State Management
- Hot reload integrates with the central State management system
- Pipeline updates are coordinated with uniform updates
- Maintains consistency between shader and uniform data
